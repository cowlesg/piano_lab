# piano_lab
The conductor reads from `input.txt` that contains space-separated numbers [1-7], each number represents a music note. The 7 piano keys correspond to the seven music notes. Once a note is conducted, the corresponding piano key will play the note by printing the music note in Solf√®ge Syllables such as "do", "re", "mi", etc.

Clone this repo, implement `conductor()` and `pianoKey()` in piano_lab.cpp **with monitors**.

Compile the program with:
```
make
```

run the program with:
```
./piano
```
